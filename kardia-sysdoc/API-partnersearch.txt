OVERVIEW...

    This document describes the partner search API for Kardia.  If you are not
    already familiar with web services, REST, and the Kardia REST API system,
    please first read "JSON-REST.txt" in centrallix-sysdoc, and read "API.txt"
    in this documentation directory.


ENDPOINT...

    The endpoint of this API will be:

	/apps/kardia/api/partnersearch

    Of course, the needed protocol (http or https) and server address (such as
    server.lightsys.org:843) will need to be added to the URL, to give
    something like:

	https://server.lightsys.org:843/apps/kardia/api/partnersearch?cx__mode=rest


OBJECT STRUCTURE...

    This API just has one collection, which is variable based on the URL
    parameter passed to it.

    /apps/kardia/api/partnersearch?string=SEARCHCRITERIA

    "SEARCHCRITERIA" should be replaced with the criteria for the search.

    The search criteria is a comma-separated list of search items.  The server
    will apply that criteria to the following data items and return a set of
    partners that best match the criteria:

	- Partner given name
	- Partner surname
	- Partner preferred name
	- Partner organization name
	- Location city
	- Location state
	- Contact data (phone/email/etc)

    The returned collection will have the following attributes:

	partner_id	    - id of the partner
	partner_name	    - first and last name (or org. name) of the
			      partner
	@partner_ref	    - a link to the partner data

	@location_ref	    - a link to the address/location data, if matched
	contact		    - contact information, if matched
	contact_type	    - type of contact information matched
	@contact_ref	    - a link to contact data, if matched

	surname		    - surname (last name) of the partner
	given_names	    - given names (first / middle) of the partner
	title		    - title (Mr / Mrs / etc)
	preferred_name	    - the salutation or nickname
	suffix		    - Jr / Sr / etc
	org_name	    - name of organization
	gender		    - gender (Male / Female / Couple)
	comments	    - misc comments about the partner
	no_mail		    - set to 1 if the partner is to receive no mail
	no_solicitations    - set to 1 if to receive no donation requests
	score		    - an integer reflecting the quality of the match
	date_created	    - date the partner data was created in Kardia
	created_by	    - username that created the data
	date_modified	    - date the partner data was modified in Kardia
	modified_by	    - username that modified the data

    Example REST query:

	http://server/apps/kardia/api/partnersearch?cx__mode=rest&cx__res_type=collection&cx__res_format=attrs&cx__res_attrs=basic&string=john,smith

    Limitations:

	separated values.
